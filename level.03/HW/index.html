<h3>PLAYING CHESS</h3>
<h5>I really like playing chess doing puzzles its interesting
    I love the strategy and patience chess requires. 
    Every game is a battle of minds, and theres always something new to learn,
     whether it's a classic opening or a tricky endgame maneuver.</h5>
<h3>SKIING</h3>
<h5>Nothing beats the rush of carving through fresh 
    powder on a crisp morning. Skiing is my escapeâ€”speed, 
    adrenaline, and the beauty of the mountains all in one.</h5>
<h3>WATCHING MOVIES</h3>
<h5>Movies are my way of exploring different worlds.
     Whether it's a mind-bending thriller, a classic drama
    , or a feel-good comedy, I love getting lost in a great story.</h5>
