<p>hello today we are going to talk about programing languages </p>
<h1>C</h1>
<h3>Developed: 1972
Creator: Dennis Ritchie
Type: Procedural, compiled
Usage: System programming, operating systems (like Linux), embedded systems
Relevance: Still widely used, especially in low-level programming 
and performance-critical applications</h3>
<h5>It is a procedural, statically typed, compiled language known for its efficiency and low-level memory access. C is widely used in system programming, operating systems, embedded systems, and performance-critical applications. Despite being one of the oldest languages, it remains 
    highly relevant, powering modern software infrastructure.</h5>
<h1>C++</h1>
<h3>Developed: 1983
 Creator: Bjarne Stroustrup
 Type: Object-oriented, compiled
Usage: Game development, high-performance applications, software systems
 Relevance: Actively used in game engines like Unreal Engine
 and large-scale software projects</h3>
 <h5>It introduced object-oriented programming while retaining the speed and efficiency of C. C++ is widely used in game development, high-performance applications, finance, and software systems. Its flexibility and performance make it essential 
    for large-scale applications and real-time processing</h5>
<h1>Java</h1>
<h3>Developed: 1995
    Creator: James Gosling (Sun Microsystems)
    Type: Object-oriented, compiled (to bytecode, runs on JVM)
    Usage: Enterprise applications, Android development, backend development
    Relevance: Still a top choice for enterprise software and Android apps</h3>
    <h5> It is an object-oriented, platform-independent language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Java is used for enterprise applications, Android development, web applications, and cloud computing. It remains one of the most widely used languages in enterprise software, 
        despite growing competition from newer languages.</h5>
<h1>Javascript</h1>
<h3>Developed: 1995
    Creator: Brendan Eich
    Type: Interpreted, dynamically typed
    Usage: Web development (front-end and back-end with Node.js)
    Relevance: Essential for modern web development, widely used</h3>
<h5>It is a dynamically typed, interpreted language that runs in web browsers and on servers via Node.js. JavaScript is essential for web development, powering interactive websites, backend services, and mobile applications. With its vast ecosystem and modern frameworks, it continues 
    to evolve as a dominant language in the digital world.</h5>
